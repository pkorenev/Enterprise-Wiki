==========
Add role model: title:string
Change prefix_rule model: role_id:integer prefix:string action_name:string

Page show:
* if can edit this page, bypass (if not, can view by editing which is the same)
* if PRIVATE, check prefix rules
* if PROTECTED, only signed in users allowed
* otherwise, it is public to all

Add markups for page body. Reference https://github.com/github/markup

.markdown -- https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet
.textile -- gem install RedCloth
    RedCloth.new(content).to_html
.rdoc -- gem install rdoc -v 3.6.1
    https://github.com/github/markup/blob/master/lib/github/markup/rdoc.rb
.org -- gem install org-ruby
    Orgmode::Parser.new(content).to_html
.creole -- gem install creole
    Creole.creolize(content)
.mediawiki -- gem install wikicloth
    WikiCloth::WikiCloth.new(:data => content).to_html(:noedit => true)
OTHERWISE -- PLAIN TEXT

Add <math> support using MathJax
--------------------------------
* Some markups will process <math> (e.g. MediaWiki) 
  or escape <math> tag (e.g. Creole), but they do not care backslashes.
  In this case, just replace <math> with \( and </math> with \)
* Some markups will process backslashes, but they allow HTML-like tags
  and do not care the embedded contents in these tags, e.g. Markdown.
  In this case, leave <math> tags and process the markup itself first.
  After it is converted into HTML, replace <math> tags with \( and \)
* Some markups will escape <math> tags, and they also process backslashes.
  RDoc works this way and it is really bothering. I will handle it later.

==========
Wanna check permissions when editing pages.
Two kinds of pages: personal and normal.
Personal pages' paths start with a tilde.

Personal Page Rules
-------------------
* bypass super-user (e.g. root)
* bypass page owner (i.e. "~xxx" xxx == current_user)
* forbid others

Normal Page Rules
-----------------
* bypass super-user (e.g. root)
* bypass white list (check prefix, i.e. starts_with?)
* forbid others

Add new model PrefixRule: user_id:integer prefix:string

Wanna add pages.
page: path:string title:string body:text editor:string revision:integer

HTTP Digest Authentication
--------------------------
* The client asks for a page that requires authentication 
  but does not provide a username and password. Typically 
  this is because the user simply entered the address or 
  followed a link to the page.
* The server responds with the 401 "client-error" response 
  code, providing the authentication realm and a randomly-
  generated, single-use value called a nonce.
* At this point, the client will present the authentication 
  realm (typically a description of the computer or system 
  being accessed) to the user and prompt for a username and 
  password. The user may decide to cancel at this point.
* Once a username and password have been supplied, the client 
  re-sends the same request but adds an authentication header 
  that includes the response code.
* In this example, the server accepts the authentication and 
  the page is returned. If the username is invalid and/or the 
  password is incorrect, the server might return the "401" 
  response code and the client would prompt the user again.

The "response" value is calculated in three steps, as follows. 
Where values are combined, they are delimited by colon symbols.
* The MD5 hash of the combined username, authentication realm 
  and password is calculated. The result is referred to as HA1.
* The MD5 hash of the combined method and digest URI is calculated, 
  e.g. of "GET" and "/dir/index.html". The result is referred to as HA2.
* The MD5 hash of the combined HA1 result, server nonce (nonce), 
  request counter (nc), client nonce (cnonce), quality of protection 
  code (qop) and HA2 result is calculated. The result is the "response" 
  value provided by the client.

See http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/HttpAuthentication/Basic.html
for a coding example. The authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest 
block must return the user's password or the ha1 digest hash so 
the framework can appropriately hash to check the user's credentials. 
Returning nil will cause authentication to fail.
